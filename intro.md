Goal is to make and deliver food for a party and the first player to reach the party with the food wins!

### # of Players
For 2-4 people who cook from beginner to advanced

### Contents:
24-48 Meal Cards

1 six-sided die (optional, use an online random number generator)

1 Playing Board/Map (optional, make your own) with 54 steps, and 5 special steps

4 playing pieces (optional, make your own)

Recipe Source (designated google, or a cookbook, or a website as your source of recipes)

### How to Play

#### Setup
This is a DIY game, where players can either use a pre-created board and cards, or make their own before starting the game.
Players choose 24 - 48 meals and make a list of meals. There should be a mix of meals familiar and unfamilar to the players. They could range from common to rare, or have 
different themes based on agreement of the players. Players create the map and their player tokens. Color in the special steps at different points along the map
with at least 7 spaces between them. Players get 3 Meal cards at beginning of game.

#### Start the Game
Meal Cards are shuffled and dealt to players at start of game. Game play is clockwise with 1 player selected to go first. 

*Meal Cards*

You can play those 3 cards or exchange them for 1 - 3 new cards.

To play a card takes one turn.

To exchange or get new cards takes 1 turn.

#### Player Turn
Player plays a Meal Card, shows it to the other players, and says, "I can make this dish for the party." 
If no other player challenges them, the player can roll the dice and move their token 1-6 spaces.

If a challenge is made, the challenged player must show they can cook the Meal shown on the card.  Players must be able to show they can do 3 of the following:

- Name the key ingredients (you can argue about spices or extra ingredients)
- Estimate the cooking time for the dish
- Describe how to cook it in steps
- What tools do you use
- The recipe can be looked up in the accepted source named before the game began.

Players vote to accept the answer. Players can vote for themselves.

If the Meal is successfully challenged, the player doesn’t roll the dice and doesn't advance.

If the player’s explanation is accepted, they can roll twice and move their token.
